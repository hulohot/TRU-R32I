## Single-Cycle Implementation Plan

### Overview
The single-cycle implementation will connect all previously implemented components (ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Program Counter, and Instruction Memory) to create a functioning CPU that can execute one instruction per clock cycle.

### Key Components Integration
1. **Data Path**
   - Connect Program Counter to Instruction Memory
   - Route instruction fields to Register File and Control Unit
   - Connect ALU inputs from Register File
   - Implement immediate generation logic
   - Route ALU results back to Register File

2. **Control Path**
   - Expand Control Unit for all instruction types
   - Add memory control signals
   - Implement result selection logic
   - Add branch decision logic

### Implementation Steps
1. Create top-level module integrating all components
2. Implement immediate generation unit
3. Add multiplexers for operand selection
4. Implement result writeback logic
5. Add branch comparison and target calculation

### Design Considerations
1. **Timing**
   - All operations must complete within one clock cycle
   - Critical path will likely be through ALU and memory
   - Need to ensure proper setup/hold times

2. **Verification Strategy**
   - Create integration tests
   - Test individual instructions
   - Test instruction sequences
   - Verify timing constraints

3. **Potential Challenges**
   - Meeting timing requirements for single-cycle
   - Handling different instruction formats
